A Decentralized Crowd Funding System on the blockchain that issues reward tokens and allows donaters to earn as long as they hold the reward tokens.

## An overview of the problem being addressed
 *An idea (eidos) is the source of a thing, its prototype, the underlying reality of any particular object.* - **Plato**

The futility of an idea is most times born through lack of resources. That goes to say that having an availaible resource is a prerequisite to an idea that comes to life. Be it a real estate project that requires a massive influx of funds, a business idea that might be the next it, a music video that might be a hit or the next brilliant startup. 

In a coventional setting, these ideas most times do not see the light of day because of lack of connections and if they do get pitched to a major financier, they sometimes are dead on arrival because of bias or some personal differences. Also pitching to major fianaciers keeps power and wealth in the hands of a select few who dish out crumbs to the people that do the hardwork.

## Solution

We propose a decentralised marketplace using blockchain technology, where creators pay a little fee to list a project that needs funding. The project will be subject to a verification process to certify that the human behind the project and the idea is real with certain documents and necessary identification. if the checks are validated, The project will be put on the market place and made availaible for users to buy into the project. While creating a project, the user indicates:
1. The percentage of profits he/she is willing to take when the project is completed and starts earning.
2. The buy-in duration, a life span of how long the contract will be valid (this could be few year or forever).
3. The amount needed to take the project live
4. How long the implementation will take.

Taking a creator percentage is an incentive for a honest creator. For example if there is a real estate project and the owner has obtained landed assest and has some amount to bulid a 10 storey building, he can put it to the market place and required additional funding to make it a 2 storey building while he takes 50% of the profit and the contract will be valid for 30 years. Providers can buy into this contract and will be issued tokens according to the percentage of the buy in amount

>TK =  buy-in * 100 / amountNeeded

These tokens will be used in calculating a return on your buy-in. These tokens will have value for the validity of the contract and can be traded, transfered, gifted, inherited and sold. For any given contract instance, there can only be 100e18 of the contract token in circulation signifiying the percentage of providers. Whilst the project profit are being shared, every token holder will get its token equivalent in percentage of the profit being shared.

> ROI = TK * profit / 100

## Future plans for the project

The project will be open-sourced and will be available on GitHub. The project will also be available on the ethereum network.
